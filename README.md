About
-----
I'm Amanuel — a solutions-focused Fullstack Engineer and System Architect who designs and delivers scalable, maintainable systems. I combine MERN-stack engineering, machine learning, and DevOps practices to build production-ready products that solve real business problems.

Core strengths: system design, robust APIs, distributed services, containerized deployments, and machine-learning-driven features.

What I deliver
--------------
- Production-quality MERN applications with clean APIs and secure authentication
- Scalable system architecture (microservices, caching, resilience patterns)
- ML integrations for analytics and recommendations
- Repeatable deployment through Docker and CI/CD

Tech stack (grouped)
--------------------
- Languages & Frameworks
  - JavaScript / TypeScript, Node.js, Express, React, Next.js
  - Python (data & ML): scikit-learn, TensorFlow, pandas

- Databases & Storage
  - MongoDB, Redis, PostgreSQL
  - S3-compatible object storage

- Infrastructure & DevOps
  - Docker, Docker Compose, CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions / GitLab CI)
  - Cloud deployment patterns (AWS / DigitalOcean)
  - Monitoring & logging concepts (Prometheus / Grafana)

- Other Tools
  - Testing: Jest, Playwright
  - Design: Figma
  - Payments & Integrations: Chapa, Telebirr, Amole

Featured projects
-----------------
PrimeHealth Medical Center System
- Role: Lead architect & fullstack implementer
- What: Enterprise-grade modular system for healthcare operations (ERP-like).
- Outcomes:
  - Role-based authentication with secure JWT + Redis hybrid session management
  - Appointment scheduling, patient record management, and billing workflows
  - HR & Finance modules (Payroll, AP/AR/GL)
  - Payment gateway integrations (Chapa, Telebirr, Amole)
  - Tests: Jest + Playwright

React ML Dashboard
- Real-time dashboard for model monitoring, dataset visualization, and inference analytics.

Figma UI/UX Portfolio
- Prototypes and design explorations focused on accessibility and handoff.

How I work
----------
- Design first: define clear, extensible system boundaries and APIs.
- Iterate fast: deliver working increments and add automation & tests early.
- Production-ready: focus on observability, security, and repeatable deployments.
